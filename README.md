# Token Gated Messaging (TGS)

## What is this?

It's simple: If you have the token, message. If you don't, read.

This is a token gated messaging platform in which anyone can read the groupchat, but only those with the token can message back and forth

## Intention, Limitations, and Learnings

I wanted to just play around with the concept of token gating. The UI isn't great and I've only supported 4 tokens out of sake of backend simiplicity + exclusivity. There's also a small security bug I found (not regarding your wallet 😜), but as a proof of concept this site works well and demonstrates the future :)
